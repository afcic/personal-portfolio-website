      <h3>INITIAL IDEA & PROBLEM SOLVING</h3>
      <p>
        I have been using the Milestone Strength workout app for a 
        few weeks now and have always found it a bit clunky. It does the job, but
        as much as I enjoy the workout plan, I am not really happy with the app. 
        So, I decided to do a fun one day re-design challenge.
        Mainly to test my skills and see how much I can get done in a day.
        
      </p>
    
    <p>
        One of the main aspects of the app I wanted to change was to make the overall design more uniform and 
        re-design a number of features that take you out of the app into the browser. This worsensed the 
        whole user experience, since it creates insecurity in the user, making it unclear where the next 
        click is going to take them. 
        I also wanted to implement a smooth and easy flow for the workout experience and better incorporate all the other aspects of the 
        company into the app.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
        The main two parts of the app are, the workout dashboard, 
        where you can see your plan and what's coming next, and the so-called explore page, 
        which showcases other aspects of the company, like their podcast, merchandise, sponsored collaborations,
        youtube channel and their blog. 

    </p>
    </br>
    <p>
        Here are a few screenshots of the current application.

        <img src="milestonestrength/ms2.jpg" alt="" class="qd-design-system" >
    </div>

      <h3>DESIGN SYSTEM</h3>
      <p>The dark theme goes with the aesthetic of the company, 
          so I wanted to keep it, but make it more uniform and use blue, 
          which they also use in the app now, as an accent colour.
          I used Font Awesome Icons and for the typeface, Ubuntu, a softer sans-serif typeface, to balance the dark theme of the app.

      <h3>RE-DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        To start with, the dashboard is the main part of the app. Since the user usually follows a set plan, it felt important to highlight 
        what the workout for the day was.
         As far as, the flow of the app during a workout, I wanted to include make everything easily scrollable between exercises, and
         create a bigger surface area to click on, instead of just the tick, for when the user is done with a rep. 
         I changed the rest button, I wanted to make it slighly less prominent, yet still easily accessible and visible.
         I also made the videos showing the exercises in-app, since they currently take you out of the browser.
        </p>
        </br>

        <p>
            The Explore page is a completely new addition to the application. 
            I decided to separate the app into two parts. One for working out and one for exploring in your 
            free time,
            the explore page showcases all the additional parts of the company and making it all part of the app. 
        </p>
            <img src="./milestonestrength/FourScreens2.png" alt="" class="mockups">
            
        <p>
            I also wanted to join together different functionalities, that were spread out across the app into profile and account. 
            Since so many people go through big transformations using the Milestone Strength workout regime, 
            I wanted for them to be able to follow it and see how their body is changing. This is already part of the app, but I wanted to incorporate it into the profile page. 
            I haven't managed to do  the journey part of the profile page, essentially
            it would be a graph showcasing the changes in measurements over time.

        </p>
        </br>
         <p>
            Account page has all the necessary basics, I also wanted to consider expanding it to hold credit card details and with it enable in-app purchases,
            for the merchandise store and new workout plans.
        </p>
        
       
         
        <h3>FUTURE DESIGN</h3>
        <p>
            The challenge was really fun way of quickly distilling the main problems and most important parts that
            needed to be changed. I would love to do a proper re-design of the application and spend more time on it.
